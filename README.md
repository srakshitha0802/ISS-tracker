An advanced, real-time aerospace flight telemetry and geospatial tracking web application for the **International Space Station (ISS, NORAD Catalog #25544)**. Powered by two primary APIs: the gold-standard **Where The ISS At? API** for real-time orbital vectors and the **DeepSeek AI API** for autonomous orbital copilot intelligence. Engineered with a sharp-edged mission control HUD aesthetic, audible 4K MP4 cosmic ambient soundtrack with 1-click unmuting and volume controls, precision Keplerian orbital mechanics, forward trajectory projections, 3D observer distance radar, and live Expedition 72 crew dossier.

## 1. Key Architectural & Design Features

### 1.1. Sharp Aerospace HUD & Theme Design System
- **Crisp Sharp Edges**: All components, cards, tables, badges, and modals feature sharp rectangular geometry (`rounded-none`) with laser-aligned corner accent brackets.
- **Deep Space Theme Palette**:
  - **Obsidian Slate Base**: `#020617` / `slate-950`
  - **Telemetry Cyan**: `#06b6d4` & `#22d3ee`
  - **Solar & Mach Amber**: `#f59e0b` & `#fbbf24`
  - **Signal Emerald**: `#10b981` & `#34d399`
- **Custom Precision Vector ISS Logo**: Bespoke SVG insignia featuring authentic space station architecture (central truss structure, port/starboard dual-axis photovoltaic solar wings, pressurized habitat modules, and orbital vector arcs).

### 1.2. High-Definition Audible Cosmic Video Background
- **Audible 4K Ambient Soundtrack**: Real-time atmospheric space audio with 1-click unmuting, animated audio equalizer, and volume slider.
- **Autoplay Compliance & Gesture Recovery**: Initial muted autoplay adheres to strict browser security policies; seamlessly unmuted upon 1-click user interaction without stutter.
- **Live Ambiance Controller**: Switch between **Cinema** (translucent HUD tint), **Vivid** (100% transparent zero-blur space view), and **Focus** (dark contrast analysis view).

### 1.3. DeepSeek AI Orbital Copilot Engine
- **Autonomous Aerospace Analyst**: Directly connects to the **DeepSeek API** (`deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner`).
- **Real-Time Telemetry Synthesis**: Injects live latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, daylight status, and overflight territory into AI flight dynamic briefings.
- **Interactive Mission Terminal**: Run preset inquiries (Orbital Free-Fall Physics, Expedition 72 Science, ARISS HAM Radio Doppler shifts) or ask custom astrophysics questions.
- **Client & Server Key Management**: Optional direct API key configuration stored securely in browser `localStorage`.

### 1.4. Real-Time Telemetry & Failover Reliability (Where The ISS At? API)
- **Where The ISS At? REST API Integration**: Regular polling with exponential backoff and rate-limit preservation.
- **Antimeridian ($\pm 180^\circ$) Date Line Split Algorithm**: Automatically detects when the space station crosses the 180th meridian and splits trajectory polylines to prevent horizontal canvas wrapping artifacts.
- **Dual Connection Pipeline**: Direct browser fetch with CORS support for GitHub Pages static hosting, backed by same-origin proxy fallbacks for server runtimes.

### 1.5. Forward Orbit Track & Sighting Distance Radar
- **90-Minute Future Orbit Track**: Projects next orbital path factoring orbital inclination ($51.64^\circ$) and Earth rotation.
- **3D Ground Distance & Slant Range**: Computes great-circle ground distance (Haversine) and true line-of-sight Euclidean distance through space factoring 420 km altitude.
- **Horizon Elevation Angles**: Instant visual sighting notifications when the ISS is above the user's horizon ($> 10^\circ$).

### 1.6. Live Expedition 72 Crew Dossier
- Real-time roster of the 7 astronauts and cosmonauts currently residing on board the space station, detailing roles, launch vehicles (SpaceX Crew-9, Soyuz MS-26), days in orbit, and spacewalk (EVA) logs.

### 1.7. Mission Control Web Audio API Synthesizer
- Built-in sound effects engine using native Web Audio API oscillators:
  - Apollo Quindar-style telemetry confirmation tone ($2524\text{ Hz}$).
  - Soft radar ping on coordinate refresh.
  - UI button tactile chimes with mute toggle.

2. Project Overview

The ISS Tracker is a web application that displays real-time information about the International Space Station (ISS). It helps users understand the station's current location and orbital movement.

3. Main Features

- Displays the ISS location using live API data.
- Shows telemetry information such as latitude, longitude, and altitude when available.
- Provides an interactive space-themed dashboard.
- Displays projected orbital paths and station information.
- Includes an AI-powered assistant for space-related questions, subject to API availability.

4. APIs Used

Where the ISS At? API

Used to retrieve ISS location and telemetry information.

DeepSeek AI API
